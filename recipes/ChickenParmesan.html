        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken parmesan is a perennial favorite at Italian restaurants, but the traditional recipe can be time-consuming to make at home. Between the homemade sauce and pounding, breading, and pan-frying the chicken – not to mention melting the cheese over the chicken in the oven – the classic preparation takes well over an hour and leaves you with a sinkful of dishes. My recipe takes a few smart shortcuts, making it doable on a weeknight, yet tastes as good as the chicken parmesan from your favorite restaurant. It’s also a wonderful dish for company since much of the prep can be done ahead of time</p>
