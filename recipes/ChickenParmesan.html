        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken parmesan is a perennial favorite at Italian restaurants, but the traditional recipe can be time-consuming to make at home. Between the homemade sauce and pounding, breading, and pan-frying the chicken – not to mention melting the cheese over the chicken in the oven – the classic preparation takes well over an hour and leaves you with a sinkful of dishes. My recipe takes a few smart shortcuts, making it doable on a weeknight, yet tastes as good as the chicken parmesan from your favorite restaurant. It’s also a wonderful dish for company since much of the prep can be done ahead of time</p>
        <p>Most recipes call for boneless skinless chicken breasts, which need to be sliced in half horizontally and pounded thin. I use chicken tenderloins, which can be quickly flattened with the palm of your hand to ensure even cooking – and, unlike the ready-to-cook thinly sliced chicken cutlets you find at the store, they are guaranteed to be tender and juicy.</p>
        <p>I recommend using jarred marinara sauce. The recipe only calls for 1-1/2 cups of sauce, so it doesn’t make sense to make it from scratch, especially when there are plenty of good store-bought options.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds chicken tenderloins</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
            <li>1½ cups panko</li>
            <li>¾ cup plus 2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano Reggiano, divided</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>½ cup flour</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>Olive oil, for cooking</li>
            <li>1½ cups homemade or store-bought marinara sauce, best quality such as Rao's or Victoria</li>
            <li>6 oz fontina, shredded (about 1½ cups)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fresh chopped basil</li>            
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by prepping the tenderloins. You may notice a white tendon at the end of the tenderloin. Go ahead and trim it off with a knife or kitchen shears. Using the palm of your hand, gently flatten the tenderloins so that they are an even 1/4-inch thickness.</li>
            <li>Season the flattened chicken all over with 1-1/4 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
            <li>In a large shallow bowl (I use a pie plate), combine the panko, 3/4 cup of the Parmigiano Reggiano, the oregano, the thyme, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.</li>
            <li>Mix well, making sure there are no clumps of cheese.</li>
            <li>Dredge the chicken in the flour, coating evenly.</li>
            <li>Dip in the eggs, letting any excess drip off; then dredge in the panko mixture, turning and patting to adhere.</li>
            <li>Place the breaded chicken on a lined baking sheet. (The recipe can be prepared up to this point, covered, and refrigerated up to 8 hours ahead of time. The breaded tenders can also be frozen for up to 3 months.)</li>
            <li>In a large nonstick skillet, heat about 1/8 inch of oil over medium heat until shimmering. Place 5 or 6 tenders in the pan in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Cook until the first side is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, until golden and cooked through. Cook the remaining chicken in the same manner, adding additional oil only if necessary.</li>
            <li>Place the cooked chicken on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the fontina and remaining 2 tablespoons Parmigiano Reggiano over the center of the chicken tenderloins, leaving the sides bare so that they remain crispy.</li>
            <li>Broil until the cheese is melted and bubbling, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Warm the marinara sauce, then taste and adjust seasoning to your liking. With store-bought sauce, I find a generous pinch of sugar and some fresh basil go a long way.</li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to a serving platter or individual plates. Spoon the marinara sauce over the cheese, again leaving the sides bare so that they stay crispy. Sprinkle with fresh basil and serve.</li>
        </ol>
