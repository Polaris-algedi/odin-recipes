        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken parmesan is a perennial favorite at Italian restaurants, but the traditional recipe can be time-consuming to make at home. Between the homemade sauce and pounding, breading, and pan-frying the chicken – not to mention melting the cheese over the chicken in the oven – the classic preparation takes well over an hour and leaves you with a sinkful of dishes. My recipe takes a few smart shortcuts, making it doable on a weeknight, yet tastes as good as the chicken parmesan from your favorite restaurant. It’s also a wonderful dish for company since much of the prep can be done ahead of time</p>
        <p>Most recipes call for boneless skinless chicken breasts, which need to be sliced in half horizontally and pounded thin. I use chicken tenderloins, which can be quickly flattened with the palm of your hand to ensure even cooking – and, unlike the ready-to-cook thinly sliced chicken cutlets you find at the store, they are guaranteed to be tender and juicy.</p>
        <p>I recommend using jarred marinara sauce. The recipe only calls for 1-1/2 cups of sauce, so it doesn’t make sense to make it from scratch, especially when there are plenty of good store-bought options.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
