    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I first tried this grapefruit crush cocktail at a pool party at my neighbor Tracy’s house, and I’ve seen it pop up on restaurant menus all summer long. It’s super refreshing and dangerously easy to drink. Made with fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice, vodka, triple sec, and lemon-lime soda, the cocktail is a riff on the popular orange crush drink that originated on Maryland’s Eastern shore at Harborside Bar & Grill, where the bartenders squeeze the juice to order using an old-fashioned citrus press. The name of the cocktail comes from “crushing” the fruit.</p>
    <p>For best results, I recommend using fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice with a bit of pulp — you’ll need two large grapefruits to make two cocktails — but if you’d rather use store-bought, look for 100% fresh-squeezed bottled juice with no sweeteners or preservatives.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 oz (½ cup) fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice, from 1 large grapefruit</li>
        <li>1 oz (2 tablespoons) vodka</li>
        <li>½ oz (1 tablespoon) triple sec (orange liqueur)</li>
        <li>2 oz (¼ cup) lemon-lime soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by squeezing the juice from the grapefruits. I use a citrus juicer like this one.</li>
        <li>Pour the grapefruit juice, vodka, and triple sec into a cocktail shaker filled with ice. Shake vigorously, and strain into a cocktail glass filled with ice. Top with the lemon-lime soda and garnish with a grapefruit slice.</li>
    </ol>
